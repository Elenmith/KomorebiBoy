Hello! 
I have created this repository, as well as the entire site for my second project, Komorebi Boy! 
Komorebi Boy is a music project in lo-fi hip hop, lo-fi jazz and downtempo climates, which has reached over 100,000 views in a few years, which is an amazing achievement for me! 

The site was created out of a passion for frontend programming using pure HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I will gladly accept any comments on the design/optimization of the site's performance or the code solutions themselves.

I certainly intend to continue working on the site and systematically improve it. 
Thanks!
