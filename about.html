            <h2>2017</h2>
            <h3>WeDon’tKnow</h3>
            <p>It was the time of the WeDon’tKnow team. The band was formed by accident and played at equally accidental venues - from school competitions, scouting parties, to bars and city New Year’s Eve.</p>
            <p>Komorebi played guitar and was also a lyricist. He even happened to clumsily perform one song.</p>

            <h3>PixieCutLovers</h3>
            <p>WeDon'tKnow played less and less, and komorebi boy moved to another city with his bassist, making it difficult to play together with the drummer, but! The bassist and komorebi formed PixieCutLovers, which managed to play only one concert in the new city and record a few songs that never saw the light of day. </p>
            <p>The songs are still lying on the disk waiting to be completed and released, someday, who knows, maybe they will be released.</p>

            <h2>2021</h2>
            <h3>The era of sales</h3>
            <p>The outbreak of the global coronavirus pandemic has resulted in an inability to create and play with others in the team - besides, everyone was already in a different city this year. 
                However, the experience gained allowed the band to create and sell songs to other artists and companies. </p>
            <p>In total, komorebi boy sold about 170 songs, receiving only positive feedback.</p>
